Qualities of a Personal Website

Technical

1. Your site should look good on every device
design mobile first?
learn about media queries!!! CSS?
at the bottom of the file you’d have something like 
@media screen nd (max-width: 580x) {
#header { etc…

All these styles will apply to a screen (browser) that is 480 pixels or less.

2. Analytics 
Know who’s using the website and what they’re doing on it.  Learn/Use about Google Analytics.  Make sure people aren’t just leaving after a couple of seconds. 

3.  Aesthetics  Your website should reflect your skills as a developer, as well as your sense of design.
